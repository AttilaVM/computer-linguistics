       "\"about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span.\\n\\ncurrently working as an international agent for a freight forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the works. online classes and trying to better myself in my free time. perhaps a hours worth of a good book or a video game on a lazy sunday.\\n\\nmaking people laugh. ranting about a good salting. finding simplicity in complexity, and complexity in simplicity.\\n\\nthe way i look. i am a six foot half asian, half caucasian mutt. it makes it tough not to notice me, and for me to blend in.\\n\\nbooks: absurdistan, the republic, of mice and men (only book that made me want to cry), catcher in the rye, the prince.  movies: gladiator, operation valkyrie, the producers, down periscope.  shows: the borgia, arrested development, game of thrones, monty python  music: aesop rock, hail mary mallon, george thorogood and the delaware destroyers, felt  food: i'm down for anything.\\n\\nfood. water. cell phone. shelter.\\n\\nduality and humorous things\\n\\ntrying to find someone to hang out with. i am down for anything except a club.\\n\\ni am new to california and looking for someone to wisper my secrets to.\""
